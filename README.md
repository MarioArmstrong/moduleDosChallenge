The intent of my portfolio was to create something simple and minimalistic with a bit of style. The part of the assingment that I had a lot of difficulty with was getting all the elements to be placed on the page exactly as I wanted. I got pretty close to perfect, but some things are still off. For example, I tried many different ways for the ul in my Contact section to not have bullets but everything I did didn't affect the page at all. I also wanted to place the li in a row, but nothing I did affected it.

I am proud to say that the project section looks and functions exactly like I wanted it to. I included a recent mobile app that I created in a course. The Other Projects item was a placeholder for future web apps that I create in this course. My feelings towards my portfolio are mixed because elements of it look exactly like I want them too, but some aspects just don't look exactly correct. A resubmission in the future will be inevitable.
